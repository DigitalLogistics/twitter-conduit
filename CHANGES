Changes from Takahiro HIMURA's original code (version 0.0.1.1)

Version 0.1.0.1

  - the userDescription and userLocation fields of the User record
    are now optional since they are not always provided

  - the statusFavorite field of the Status record is now populated 
    from the "favorited" field of the JSON rather than "favorite"

Version 0.0.1.2

  - restricts the authenticate package since version 0.11 has switched
    to the conduit package which conflicts with the use of enumerator

  - added a Setup.hs to stop sdist from complaining
